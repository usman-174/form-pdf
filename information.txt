Tech Stack: Next.js + Tailwind CSS

 Objective 
Build a web-based proof-of-concept (POC) where users can: 
1. Upload a PDF. 
2. Drag and drop custom text onto the PDF canvas. 
3. Modify the added text (font, size, color). 
4. Download the modified PDF. 
The main goal is to ensure the functionality works correctly and is free of bugs. Design is flexible 
— no visual restrictions. ---

 Core Features & Functional Requirements 
1. PDF Upload 
Users can upload a .pdf file (preferably max 10–20 pages). 
Uploaded PDF will be rendered on the screen using a viewer (e.g., pdfjs or react-pdf). 
2. Text Drag & Drop 
Users can add new text blocks onto the PDF by: 
Clicking “Add Text” or dragging a text element from a panel. 
Positioning it anywhere on the PDF. 
Each text block must support: 
Font styles: Bold, Italic, Underline. 
Font family: At least 2–3 basic fonts (e.g., Arial, Times, Courier). 
Font size adjustment. 
Font color selection. 
This should preserve alignment and match surrounding PDF text as closely as possible (in font, 
size, and position). 
Optional: Suggest default font/size based on scanned PDF text if feasible. 
4. Canvas Navigation 
User should be able to scroll through PDF pages. 
Text elements should remain in their positions across interactions. 
5. PDF Download 
On clicking "Download", the user receives a new PDF with: 
Original content unchanged. 
All added or edited text properly embedded at correct positions. ---
